# RocketCommunityBuild2019-Bangalore
This repository is for project done as part of Rocket Community Build 2019 at MSRIT. Theme for the same is: EBeats.

# E-Beats Concept:
Police department has to invest a lot of time and manual effort to track the patrolling(Beats) by police personnels in designated areas. 
The patrolling has to happen 24*7 and they need to maintain the record of the same and make sure that the police personnels are actually 
doing the same.

By this concept which we are planning to implement, we are trying to make this process simpler and automated by using latest technology i.e. 
Android based client for Police personnel patrolling the area & Web based client for accessing the related reports and data.

We organized a hackathon on 25th and 26th April and asked students to create a POC and demo the same to us at MSRIT college.

7 Teams participated involving 33 bright brains.
